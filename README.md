# Project Details
You are a Data Scientist working for Hilton International Hotels and need to help the management decide on
the strategies that will lead to revenue growth.
You have a dataset containing information on the various chain of hotels, including when customers made
the booking, length of stay, the number of adults, children, or babies, and the number of available parking
spaces, among other things.
Given this dataset, perform data exploration, data cleaning, and analysis to come with appropriate
recommendations. As a start, while performing data analysis, you ask the following questions from the
given dataset. Make sure that you have a visualization for each question.
● How many bookings were canceled?
● What was the booking ratio between resort hotels and city hotels?
● What was the percentage of booking for each year?
● Which was the busiest month for hotels?
● Most guests came from which country?
● How long do most people stay in hotels?
● Which was the most booked accommodation type (Single, Couple, Family)?
